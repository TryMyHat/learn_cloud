# Cloud learning

This is going to be AWS-centric  (Amazon Web Services), since that is what I am working with.  I would imagine there are similar resources available for Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure.

I tried to find a short video that would cover the reasons that I am so excited about cloud computing.  Everything I found was too long, too dry, too technical, or too fluffy.  So, I’ll try to do this part on my own.

I am excited about cloud computing because it makes major computing projects more attainable.  AWS has created building blocks that you can put together to make systems that would have taken hundreds of dollars, hundreds of hours, and a lot of experience to create in the past.  Want to learn how Linux works?  Fire up a free EC2 instance and play around with it.  If you brick it because you thought it would be fun to do your own DoD STIG on it, just terminate it and deploy a new one.  Want your own WordPress site?  You can put one up in 10 minutes.   Built an app that you’ve tested on your iPhone, but want to see if it works on Android too without buying a bunch of phones?  AWS has a device farm your can use.  Want to build apps for your Alexa?  Want to use image analysis?  Want to build video games?  Want to automate your deployments so that, if something goes wrong, it will roll back immediately?  And if your application takes off, it will scale up or down as needed, automatically?

## Resources from AWS
### Overview of AWS Services
https://aws.amazon.com/what-is-cloud-computing/?nc2=h_l2_cc

AWS has a lot of online resources available.  First and foremost is the platform itself.  You can sign up with a credit card, and build your own environment.  In many cases, the resources that you are using are part of the free tier, and won’t cost you anything for the first year.  I recommend not opening an account until you are ready.  I started one, but didn’t get as far as putting in my credit card. I went back in later to finish, and was surprised they were using the date that I started, not when I completed the account.

### Basic videos and labs:
https://aws.amazon.com/training/intro_series/

There are also a number of 10 Minute Tutorials that will show you how to deploy wordpress sites, server instances, databases, etc.
https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/tutorials/

AWS puts a lot of videos out on YouTube.  You can watch sessions from re:Invent, their huge annual conference, there. I got to see the rollout of the 18-wheeler thumb drive live; it was pretty spectacular.  There was even an interesting session on how the governement is using cloud: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RmiFU4L_FaU&index=5&list=PLhr1KZpdzukfuH92ynLBeCo0tpH68z7ul


### Courses
There is a free (at this moment) course from Linux Academy on Udemy, that is a project based lab type class.  I only made it halfway through, but I do want to go back to it.  https://www.udemy.com/aws-essentials/ There was also a nice overview one, but I don’t think it is still there. 
Linux Academy of course has its own site, https://linuxacademy.com/amazon-web-services/courses, and they offer a free 7 day trial.

A Cloud guru also has one: https://acloud.guru/learn/aws-technical-essentials


## Certifications
So, if you have looked at all of that, and think this might be a fun direction for your career, I would actually suggest you study for a certification.  I have found training to be unexpectedly inexpensive.  And, there is a good reason for this: training companies that specialize in cloud are able to produce and host their video content for cheap, meaning they can afford to provide it at low cost.  

Udemy had a pretty good course that was an Intro to AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate Exam (https://www.udemy.com/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate-in-30-days/learn/v4/overview), that was focused on preparing for and actually taking the exam mor.  

I believe a Udemy course is how I got on email mailing list gives 10 practice questions a week. It is months after I passed the exam, and I still click through these questions weekly, just to make sure I’m not losing what I’ve learned.  And, of course, they offer additional classes, too. http://awspro.academy/sign-up-for-our-newsletter/

I have taken the Solutions Architect Associate course from A Cloud Guru (https://acloud.guru/).  I actually purchased the course during a www.udemy.com sale ($15), but it has also been on sale on the acloudguru site for $29 (https://acloud.guru/learn/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate ), for 22 hours of training.  Because AWS is constantly updating, some of the lessons need to be updated, and there were of few sections where I gritted my teeth because we were not securing anything.  But overall I thought it was worth the time and money.  Sitting for the exam is only $150, too. https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-solutions-architect-associate/

I did buy the book from Amazon, but used it more as a reference. (https://www.amazon.com/Certified-Solutions-Architect-Official-Study/dp/1119138558/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1492192041&sr=8-1&keywords=aws+solution+architect+book)
There were a couple of online tests with it that I used.  Helpful, but not nearly as good as taking the actual practice test you can purchase when you are purchasing the exam.
Cloud Security Alliance(CSA) also has a certification, the CCSK.  I don’t have that one yet, and will update this when I do.  https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/education/ccsk/#_overview

CSA also joined forces with ISC2 on the Certified Cloud Security Professional (CCSP). https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/education/ccsp/#_overview https://www.isc2.org/en/Certifications/CCSP 

## Continued Learning
